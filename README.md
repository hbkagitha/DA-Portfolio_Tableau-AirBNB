## Project Overview 

- Use the data set, which includes listings, reviews, and calendar information.

## Visualizations
The final dashboard includes three visualizations:

- A map of Seattle colored by zip code, showing the average price of Airbnb listings in each zip code.
- A bar chart showing the number of Airbnb listings by bedroom count.
- A line chart showing the average price of Airbnb listings over time.
